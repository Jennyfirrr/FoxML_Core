# Refactoring & Backward Compatibility Wrappers

**Understanding the modular structure and how wrappers maintain compatibility**

## Overview

Large monolithic files (3,000-4,500 lines) were split into modular components in December 2025 for better maintainability. To ensure **100% backward compatibility**, thin wrapper files were created that re-export all functionality from the new modular structure.

**Key Point**: Your existing code continues to work unchanged. The wrappers make the refactoring transparent to users.

---

## What Was Refactored

Three large files were split into focused modules:

### 1. `models/specialized_models.py` (4,518 → 82 lines)

**Split into**: `models/specialized/` with 8 modules:
- `wrappers.py` - Model wrapper classes
- `predictors.py` - Predictor classes
- `trainers.py` - Core training functions
- `trainers_extended.py` - Extended training functions
- `metrics.py` - Metrics functions
- `data_utils.py` - Data loading/preparation
- `core.py` - Main orchestration
- `constants.py` - Shared constants

### 2. `ranking/rank_target_predictability.py` (3,454 → 56 lines)

**Split into**: `ranking/predictability/` with 7 modules:
- `scoring.py` - TargetPredictabilityScore class
- `composite_score.py` - Composite score calculation
- `data_loading.py` - Config and data loading
- `leakage_detection.py` - Leakage detection
- `model_evaluation.py` - Model training & evaluation
- `reporting.py` - Report generation
- `main.py` - Entry point

### 3. `train_with_strategies.py` (2,523 → 66 lines)

**Split into**: `training_strategies/` with 7 modules:
- `setup.py` - Bootstrap and setup
- `family_runners.py` - Family execution
- `utils.py` - Utility functions
- `data_preparation.py` - Data preparation
- `training.py` - Core training functions
- `strategies.py` - Strategy implementations
- `main.py` - Entry point

---

## How Wrappers Work

The original files are now **thin backward-compatibility wrappers** that re-export everything from the new modules.

### Example: `specialized_models.py` Wrapper

```python
"""
Specialized model classes - backward compatibility wrapper.

This file has been split into modules in the specialized/ subfolder for better maintainability.
All imports are re-exported here to maintain backward compatibility.
"""

# Re-export everything from the specialized modules
from TRAINING.models.specialized import *

# Also export main directly for script execution
from TRAINING.models.specialized.core import main

__all__ = [
    # Wrappers
    'TFSeriesRegressor',
    'GMMRegimeRegressor',
    'OnlineChangeHeuristic',
    # Predictors
    'GANPredictor',
    'ChangePointPredictor',
    # Trainers
    'train_changepoint_heuristic',
    'train_ftrl_proximal',
    # ... (all other exports)
]
```

### How It Works

1. **Wildcard Import**: `from TRAINING.models.specialized import *` imports everything from the `specialized/` package's `__init__.py`
2. **Explicit Re-export**: The `__all__` list explicitly declares what's exported (Python best practice)
3. **Direct Imports**: Specific items like `main` are imported directly for script execution
4. **Transparent**: Code using the old import path gets the exact same objects from the new modules

---

## Import Patterns

### Old Way (Still Works - Backward Compatible)

```python
# These all work exactly as before:
from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import train_model, TFSeriesRegressor
from TRAINING.ranking.rank_target_predictability import evaluate_target_predictability
from TRAINING.train_with_strategies import train_models_for_interval_comprehensive
```

**What happens:**
1. Python imports `specialized_models.py` (the wrapper)
2. Wrapper imports everything from `models/specialized/`
3. Your code receives the same objects it always did
4. **Zero changes needed** in your code

### New Way (Recommended for New Code)

```python
# Direct imports from the modular structure:
from TRAINING.models.specialized.core import train_model
from TRAINING.models.specialized.wrappers import TFSeriesRegressor
from TRAINING.ranking.predictability.model_evaluation import evaluate_target_predictability
from TRAINING.training_strategies.execution.training import train_models_for_interval_comprehensive
```

**Benefits:**
- More explicit about which module provides the functionality
- Better IDE autocomplete and navigation
- Clearer code organization
- Easier to understand dependencies

---

## Why Wrappers Exist

### 1. **Zero Breaking Changes**

Without wrappers, all existing code would break:
```python
# This would fail:
from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import train_model  # ❌ Module not found
```

With wrappers:
```python
# This still works:
from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import train_model  # ✅ Works perfectly
```

### 2. **Gradual Migration**

Users can migrate at their own pace:
- **Existing code**: Continues using old import paths (wrappers handle it)
- **New code**: Can use new modular imports
- **Mixed code**: Both patterns work simultaneously

### 3. **Transparent Refactoring**

The refactoring is **internal only** - users don't need to know about it:
- Same API
- Same behavior
- Same imports
- Better code organization (internal)

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Using Specialized Models

**Old way (still works):**
```python
from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import train_model, TFSeriesRegressor

# Use as before
model = train_model(...)
regressor = TFSeriesRegressor(...)
```

**New way (recommended):**
```python
from TRAINING.models.specialized.core import train_model
from TRAINING.models.specialized.wrappers import TFSeriesRegressor

# Same functionality, clearer imports
model = train_model(...)
regressor = TFSeriesRegressor(...)
```

### Example 2: Target Ranking

**Old way (still works):**
```python
from TRAINING.ranking.rank_target_predictability import evaluate_target_predictability

score = evaluate_target_predictability(target, data, ...)
```

**New way (recommended):**
```python
from TRAINING.ranking.predictability.model_evaluation import evaluate_target_predictability

score = evaluate_target_predictability(target, data, ...)
```

### Example 3: Training Strategies

**Old way (still works):**
```python
from TRAINING.train_with_strategies import train_models_for_interval_comprehensive

results = train_models_for_interval_comprehensive(interval, ...)
```

**New way (recommended):**
```python
from TRAINING.training_strategies.execution.training import train_models_for_interval_comprehensive

results = train_models_for_interval_comprehensive(interval, ...)
```

---

## CLI Usage

### Old CLI Paths (Still Work)

```bash
# These still work via wrappers:
python -m TRAINING.models.specialized_models
python -m TRAINING.ranking.rank_target_predictability
python TRAINING/train_with_strategies.py
```

### New CLI Paths (Recommended)

```bash
# Direct module execution:
python -m TRAINING.models.specialized.core
python -m TRAINING.ranking.predictability.main
python -m TRAINING.training_strategies.main
```

## Migration Guide

### Do I Need to Migrate?

**Short answer: No.** Your existing code works unchanged.

### Should I Migrate?

**Optional, but recommended for new code:**
- ✅ Better IDE support (autocomplete, navigation)
- ✅ Clearer code organization
- ✅ Easier to understand dependencies
- ✅ Future-proof (wrappers may be deprecated eventually)

### How to Migrate

1. **Identify old imports:**
   ```python
   from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import ...
   from TRAINING.ranking.rank_target_predictability import ...
   from TRAINING.train_with_strategies import ...
   ```

2. **Find new locations:**
   - Check `DOCS/03_technical/refactoring/` for module maps
   - Use IDE "Go to Definition" to find actual location
   - Check wrapper file's `__all__` list for hints

3. **Update imports:**
   ```python
   # Old
   from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import train_model
   
   # New
   from TRAINING.models.specialized.core import train_model
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Run your code to ensure behavior is identical
   - Check that all functionality works as expected

## Technical Details

### Import Resolution

When you import from a wrapper:

```python
from TRAINING.models.specialized_models import train_model
```

**What Python does:**
1. Loads `specialized_models.py` (the wrapper)
2. Executes `from TRAINING.models.specialized import *`
3. This loads `specialized/__init__.py` which imports from all submodules
4. The `train_model` function is now available in the wrapper's namespace
5. Your import succeeds and you get the actual function from `specialized/core.py`

**Result**: You're using the exact same code, just through a different import path.

### Performance

**No performance impact:**
- Imports are cached by Python
- Wrapper overhead is negligible (just import statements)
- Runtime performance is identical

### Maintenance

**Wrappers are maintained:**
- Updated when new exports are added
- `__all__` lists are kept in sync
- Deprecation warnings may be added in the future (but not yet)

## Summary

- ✅ **Wrappers maintain 100% backward compatibility**
- ✅ **Your existing code works unchanged**
- ✅ **New modular imports are available (recommended for new code)**
- ✅ **Both import patterns work simultaneously**
- ✅ **No performance impact**
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes**

The refactoring improved code organization internally while keeping the user-facing API identical. Wrappers make this transparent - you can continue using old imports or migrate to new ones at your own pace.
