# Pressure Test Plan

Plan for stress testing the trading system under extreme conditions.

## Overview

Pressure tests validate system behavior under:
- High volatility
- Rapid price movements
- API disconnections
- High order volume
- Extreme market conditions

## Test Scenarios

### 1. High Volatility

**Scenario**: Market volatility spikes (VIX > 30)

**Tests**:
- Position sizing adjustments
- Risk limit enforcement
- Model confidence degradation
- Emergency mode activation

### 2. Rapid Price Movements

**Scenario**: Large price gaps or flash crashes

**Tests**:
- Barrier gate responses
- Stop-loss execution
- Position flattening
- State machine transitions

### 3. API Disconnections

**Scenario**: API disconnects during operation

**Tests**:
- Automatic reconnection
- Order reconciliation
- State recovery
- Graceful degradation

### 4. High Order Volume

**Scenario**: System processes many symbols simultaneously

**Tests**:
- Throughput limits
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
- Latency under load

## Test Procedures

### Run Pressure Tests

```bash
./run_comprehensive_test.sh
```

### Monitor During Tests

```bash
# Watch logs
tail -f logs/ibkr_trading.log

# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check API connection
python SCRIPTS/check_ibkr_connection.py
```

## Success Criteria

1. **No Crashes**: System remains stable
2. **Safety Guards Active**: All guards function correctly
3. **Performance Acceptable**: Latency within limits
4. **Recovery Successful**: System recovers from failures
