# Detailed Changelog

**This file has been split into per-day changelogs for better organization and maintainability.**

## New Location

The detailed changelog is now organized by date in the `changelog/` directory:

- **[Changelog Index](changelog/README.md)** – Start here for navigation
- **[2025-12-11](changelog/2025-12-11.md)** – Reproducibility Tracking, Leakage Fixes, Interval Detection, Param Sanitization
- **[2025-12-10](changelog/2025-12-10.md)** – SST Enforcement, Determinism System, Config Centralization
- **[General](changelog/general.md)** – Intelligent Training Framework, Leakage Safety Suite, Configuration System, Documentation

## Why the Change?

The detailed changelog had grown beyond what a single file should carry. Splitting by day provides:

- **Easier navigation** – One-screen index instead of scrolling through 800+ lines
- **No merge conflicts** – Separate files per day prevent conflicts during heavy development
- **Better organization** – Thematic grouping by date makes it easy to find when features landed
- **More maintainable** – Future changes go to new daily files, keeping history clean
- **Professional appearance** – Matches how enterprise infrastructure repos (Kubernetes, PyTorch, Databricks) organize their changelogs
