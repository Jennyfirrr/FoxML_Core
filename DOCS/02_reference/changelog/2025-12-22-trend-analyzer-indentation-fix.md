# Trend Analyzer Indentation Fix

**Date**: 2025-12-22  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Impact**: High - Trend analyzer was completely non-functional due to syntax errors  
**Breaking**: No

## Summary

Fixed critical indentation errors in `trend_analyzer.py` that prevented the module from loading, making all trend analysis functionality unavailable. The errors were caused by incorrect indentation when the target-first structure support was added.

## Problem

The trend analyzer had `IndentationError` syntax errors preventing it from loading:
1. **Line 204**: `if targets_dir.exists():` was not indented inside the `for current_run_dir in runs_to_process:` loop
2. **Line 301**: `try:` block was incorrectly indented - should be inside the `for cohort_dir in view_dir.iterdir():` loop

These errors caused:
- `IndentationError: unexpected indent` when Python tried to compile the module
- Complete failure to import `TrendAnalyzer` class
- All trend analysis functionality was unavailable (trend summaries, cohort trends, run comparisons)

## Root Cause

The indentation errors occurred during previous refactoring when target-first structure support was added. Code blocks were not properly nested within their parent loops, causing syntax errors.

## Solution

### Fix 1: Correct indentation at line 204

**File**: `TRAINING/common/utils/trend_analyzer.py`

Moved `if targets_dir.exists():` block inside the `for current_run_dir in runs_to_process:` loop:

```python
# Before (WRONG):
for current_run_dir in runs_to_process:
    targets_dir = current_run_dir / "targets"
if targets_dir.exists():  # ❌ Wrong indentation - outside loop
    for target_dir in targets_dir.iterdir():
        ...

# After (FIXED):
for current_run_dir in runs_to_process:
    targets_dir = current_run_dir / "targets"
    if targets_dir.exists():  # ✅ Correct indentation - inside loop
        for target_dir in targets_dir.iterdir():
            ...
```

### Fix 2: Correct indentation at line 301

**File**: `TRAINING/common/utils/trend_analyzer.py`

Fixed `try:` block indentation inside the `for cohort_dir in view_dir.iterdir():` loop:

```python
# Before (WRONG):
for cohort_dir in view_dir.iterdir():
    metrics_file = None
    metrics_data = {}
        try:  # ❌ Wrong indentation
            ...

# After (FIXED):
for cohort_dir in view_dir.iterdir():
    metrics_file = None
    metrics_data = {}
    try:  # ✅ Correct indentation
        ...
```

### Fix 3: Cascading indentation fixes

Fixed all nested blocks that were misaligned due to the main indentation errors:
- SYMBOL_SPECIFIC view processing block
- CROSS_SECTIONAL view processing block
- All nested loops and conditionals within those blocks

## Files Changed

1. **`TRAINING/common/utils/trend_analyzer.py`**:
   - Fixed indentation at line 204 (`if targets_dir.exists():`)
   - Fixed indentation at line 301 (`try:` block)
   - Fixed cascading indentation issues in nested blocks

## Verification

1. **Syntax check**: `python3 -m py_compile TRAINING/common/utils/trend_analyzer.py` - passes (exit code 0)
2. **Import test**: `from TRAINING.common.utils.trend_analyzer import TrendAnalyzer` - succeeds
3. **Linting**: No linter errors

## Impact

- **Before**: Trend analyzer failed to load with `IndentationError`, preventing all trend analysis functionality
- **After**: Trend analyzer loads correctly and can:
  - Load artifact index from target-first structure
  - Process both SYMBOL_SPECIFIC and CROSS_SECTIONAL views
  - Analyze trends across runs
  - Generate trend summaries and cohort trends
