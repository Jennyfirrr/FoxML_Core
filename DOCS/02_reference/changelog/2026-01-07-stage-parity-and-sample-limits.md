# Stage Parity, Sample Limits & Task-Type Filtering

**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Category**: Reproducibility, Determinism, Data Consistency, Routing  
**Impact**: High (fixes data sampling bug, adds TRAINING stage tracking, prevents garbage aggregations)

## Summary

Six major improvements:
1. Fixed Feature Selection loading entire data history instead of respecting sample limits
2. Added full parity tracking for TRAINING stage (Stage 3)
3. Completed FS snapshot parity with TARGET_RANKING snapshots
4. **NEW**: Task-type filtering prevents incompatible model families from polluting aggregations
5. **NEW**: Task-aware metrics schema - no more `pos_rate: 0.0` on regression targets
6. **NEW**: Canonical metric naming - unambiguous metric names across all stages

## Problem

1. **Sample Limit Bug**: `compute_cross_sectional_importance()` was loading ALL data (~188k samples per symbol) instead of respecting `max_samples_per_symbol` config (e.g., 2k)
2. **No TRAINING Tracking**: Stage 3 had no snapshot mechanism - couldn't verify model determinism
3. **FS Snapshot Gaps**: Missing fields like `split_signature`, `metrics_sha256`, `n_effective`

## Changes

### Sample Limit Consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `TRAINING/ranking/cross_sectional_feature_ranker.py`
- `TRAINING/ranking/feature_selector.py`

**Fix:**
```python
# Before (loading ALL data):
mtf_data = load_mtf_data_for_ranking(data_dir, symbols)

# After (respecting limit):
mtf_data = load_mtf_data_for_ranking(data_dir, symbols, max_rows_per_symbol=max_rows_per_symbol)
```

**Impact:**
- All 3 stages (TR/FS/TRAINING) now use consistent `.tail(N)` sampling
- Expected: `n: 2000` per symbol instead of `n: 188779`

### TRAINING Stage Full Parity Tracking

**New Files:**
- `TRAINING/training_strategies/reproducibility/__init__.py`
- `TRAINING/training_strategies/reproducibility/schema.py`
- `TRAINING/training_strategies/reproducibility/io.py`

**New Schema (`TrainingSnapshot`):**
```python
@dataclass
class TrainingSnapshot:
    run_id: str
    timestamp: str
    stage: str = "TRAINING"
    view: str  # CROSS_SECTIONAL or SYMBOL_SPECIFIC
    target: str
    symbol: Optional[str]
    model_family: str
    
    # Fingerprints
    model_artifact_sha256: Optional[str]  # Hash of saved model file
    predictions_sha256: Optional[str]
    feature_fingerprint_input: Optional[str]
    feature_fingerprint_output: Optional[str]
    hyperparameters_signature: Optional[str]
    
    # Comparison group
    comparison_group: Dict[str, Any]  # Full parity with TR/FS
```

**Integration:**
- `TRAINING/training_strategies/execution/training.py` calls `create_and_save_training_snapshot()` after model save
- Global index: `globals/training_snapshot_index.json`

### FS Snapshot Full Parity

**Files Modified:**
- `TRAINING/stability/feature_importance/schema.py`
- `TRAINING/stability/feature_importance/io.py`
- `TRAINING/stability/feature_importance/hooks.py`

**New Fields in `FeatureSelectionSnapshot`:**
- `snapshot_seq`: Sequence number
- `metrics_sha256`: Hash of outputs.metrics
- `artifacts_manifest_sha256`: Hash of output artifacts
- `fingerprint_sources`: Documentation of fingerprint meanings
- `comparison_group.n_effective`: Row count
- `comparison_group.hyperparameters_signature`: Model config hash
- `comparison_group.feature_registry_hash`: Feature registry version
- `comparison_group.comparable_key`: Full reproducibility key

**Seed Fix:**
```python
# Before (derived seed - broke consistency):
train_seed = hash(base_seed + universe_sig)  # e.g., 198258262

# After (direct seed - consistent across stages):
train_seed = base_seed  # 42
```

## Verification

After next E2E run, check:

1. **Sample limits respected:**
   ```json
   // metadata.json
   "per_symbol_stats": {
     "AAPL": { "n": 2000 },  // was 188779
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **TRAINING snapshots created:**
   ```
   globals/training_snapshot_index.json
   ```

3. **FS snapshots have full parity:**
   ```json
   // fs_snapshot.json
   "comparison_group": {
     "train_seed": 42,  // was 198258262
     "n_effective": 20000,
     "comparable_key": "..."
   }
   ```

### Task-Type Model Filtering

Prevents incompatible model families from training on wrong task types, avoiding garbage scores in aggregations.

**New in `TRAINING/training_strategies/utils.py`:**

```python
# FAMILY_CAPS now includes supported_tasks
FAMILY_CAPS = {
    "lightgbm": {...},  # All tasks (no restriction)
    "elastic_net": {..., "supported_tasks": ["regression"]},
    "logistic_regression": {..., "supported_tasks": ["binary", "multiclass"]},
    "ngboost": {..., "supported_tasks": ["regression", "binary"]},
    ...
}

def is_family_compatible(family: str, task_type) -> tuple:
    """SST single source of truth for task-type filtering."""
    ...
```

**Filter Applied in All 3 Stages:**
- `TRAINING/ranking/predictability/model_evaluation.py` - Stage 1 (TARGET_RANKING)
- `TRAINING/ranking/multi_model_feature_selection.py` - Stage 2 (FEATURE_SELECTION)
- `TRAINING/training_strategies/execution/training.py` - Stage 3 (TRAINING)

**Families Constrained:**
| Family | Supported Tasks |
|--------|-----------------|
| elastic_net, ridge, lasso | regression |
| logistic_regression | binary, multiclass |
| ngboost | regression, binary |
| quantile_lightgbm | regression |

### Task-Aware Metrics Schema

Fixes `pos_rate: 0.0` appearing on regression targets.

**New Files:**
- `CONFIG/ranking/metrics_schema.yaml` - Task-specific metric definitions
- `TRAINING/ranking/predictability/metrics_schema.py` - Cached loader + `compute_target_stats()`

**Behavior Change:**

| Task Type | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Regression | `pos_rate: 0.0` (garbage) | `y_mean`, `y_std`, `y_min`, `y_max`, `y_finite_pct` |
| Binary | `pos_rate: 0.35` | `pos_rate: 0.35`, `class_balance: {0: 650, 1: 350}` |
| Multiclass | `pos_rate: 0.0` (garbage) | `class_balance: {...}`, `n_classes: 3` |

### Canonical Metric Naming

**Problem:**
The `auc` field in `TargetPredictabilityScore` was overloaded:
- Regression: stored R²
- Binary: stored ROC-AUC
- Multiclass: stored accuracy

This caused confusion when comparing metrics across task types.

**Solution:**
Replace overloaded `auc` with task-specific, view-aware metric names.

**Naming Convention:**
```
<metric_base>__<view>__<aggregation>
```

Where:
- `view` = `cs` (cross-sectional) or `sym` (symbol-specific)
- `aggregation` = `mean`, `std`, `pooled`

**Examples:**
| Task Type | View | Primary Metric Name |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| REGRESSION | CROSS_SECTIONAL | `spearman_ic__cs__mean` |
| REGRESSION | SYMBOL_SPECIFIC | `r2__sym__mean` |
| BINARY_CLASSIFICATION | CROSS_SECTIONAL | `roc_auc__cs__mean` |
| BINARY_CLASSIFICATION | SYMBOL_SPECIFIC | `roc_auc__sym__mean` |
| MULTICLASS_CLASSIFICATION | CROSS_SECTIONAL | `accuracy__cs__mean` |

**Files Modified:**
- `CONFIG/ranking/metrics_schema.yaml` - Added `canonical_names` section
- `TRAINING/ranking/predictability/metrics_schema.py` - Added `get_canonical_metric_name()`, `get_canonical_metric_names_for_output()`
- `TRAINING/ranking/predictability/scoring.py` - Added `view` field, `primary_metric_name` property
- `TRAINING/ranking/predictability/model_evaluation.py` - Use canonical names in metrics output
- `TRAINING/training_strategies/reproducibility/schema.py` - Use canonical names in TrainingSnapshot

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Deprecated `auc` field kept for backward compat
- Old code reading `auc` continues to work
- New code should use `primary_metric_name` property

## Determinism Impact

**None.** Changes are:
- Bug fix (sample limits - was loading wrong data)
- Observational (new tracking)
- Metadata enrichment
- Routing (task-type filtering - skips incompatible families before training)
- Naming (canonical metrics are cosmetic, same values)

Model computation unchanged when inputs are correct.
