## What Works Today ✅

### Full TRAINING Pipeline
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **Components**:
  - Target ranking with auto-discovery
  - Multi-model feature selection
  - Training plan generation
  - Model training (all 20 families)
- **Recent Updates** (2025-12-12):
  - GPU acceleration for target ranking and feature selection
  - SST compliance for all GPU settings
  - Experiment configuration system
  - Active sanitization (Ghost Buster)

### Training Routing & Planning System
- **Status**: ✅ Functional, under active testing
- **Components**:
  - Config-driven routing decisions
  - Automatic training plan generation
  - 2-stage training pipeline (CPU → GPU)
  - One-command end-to-end flow
- **Documentation**: [Training Routing Guide](../training_routing/README.md)

### GPU Acceleration
- **Status**: ✅ Enabled for target ranking and feature selection
- **Supported Models**:
  - LightGBM: CUDA and OpenCL support
  - XGBoost: CUDA support (new and legacy API)
  - CatBoost: GPU support
- **Configuration**: All settings in `CONFIG/training_config/gpu_config.yaml` (SST)
- **Recent Updates** (2025-12-12):
  - Fully config-driven (no hardcoded values) - SST compliance achieved
  - All GPU detection parameters use `get_cfg()` directly (not `.get()` with hardcoded defaults)
  - Automatic GPU detection with graceful fallback
  - Support for disabling GPU test for faster startup (`test_enabled: false`)
  - Better logging: Always shows GPU status (not just when `gpu_detail` enabled)
  - XGBoost: Tries both new API (`device='cuda'`) and legacy API (`tree_method='gpu_hist'`)

### Single Source of Truth (SST) & Determinism
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Coverage**:
  - All model hyperparameters from config
  - All random seeds from determinism system
  - All decision policy thresholds from config
  - All stability analysis parameters from config
  - All temporal safety defaults from config
  - All GPU settings from config
- **Recent Updates** (2025-12-12):
  - GPU detection fully config-driven
  - Mutual Information random_state SST compliance
  - No hardcoded defaults remaining

### Reproducibility Tracking
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Features**:
  - End-to-end tracking across ranking, feature selection, training
  - Per-model metrics and three-tier classification (STABLE/DRIFTING/DIVERGED)
  - Trend analysis with exponential decay weighting
  - Cohort-based organization
  - Sample size binning for RESULTS directory

### Leakage Detection & Auto-Fix
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Components**:
  - Pre-training leak detection
  - Automatic feature exclusion
  - Final Gatekeeper (last-mile safety enforcement)
  - Active sanitization (Ghost Buster)
  - Comprehensive diagnostics

## Experimental Features ⚠️

### Decision-Making System
- **Status**: ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL - Under active testing
- **Components**:
  - Decision Policies (feature instability, route instability, etc.)
  - Decision Engine
  - Bayesian Patch Policy
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires 5+ runs before Bayesian recommendations
  - Thresholds may need adjustment

- **Recommendation**: Use `dry_run` mode until validated
- **See**: [Known Issues](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for details

### Stability Analysis
- **Status**: ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL - Under active testing
- **Limitations**: Thresholds may need adjustment based on data characteristics
