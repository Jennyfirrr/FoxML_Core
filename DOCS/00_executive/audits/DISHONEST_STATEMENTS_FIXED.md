# Dishonest Statements Fixed - Final Pass

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ⚠️ "fully implemented" vs "under testing" Contradiction

**Location**: `README.md` line 35

**Problem**: 
- README says "cross-sectional training fully implemented"
- But `DOCS/02_reference/testing/TESTING_NOTICE.md` says "Training Routing System - Currently being tested"
- Contradiction: Can't be both "fully implemented" and "under testing"

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "cross-sectional training implemented; symbol-specific execution pending; under testing"
- More honest about testing status

### 2. ⚠️ "automatically use GPU" - Too Absolute

**Location**: `README.md` line 31

**Problem**: 
- "automatically use GPU" implies it always works
- Reality: GPU may fail, fallback to CPU, requires proper setup

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "use GPU when available"
- Removed "automatically" (too absolute)

### 3. ⚠️ "leakage-safe validation" - Absolute Claim

**Location**: `README.md` line 160

**Problem**: 
- "safe" implies guaranteed protection
- Reality: Detection system exists but is "under validation"

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "leakage detection validation"
- More accurate description

### 4. ⚠️ "zero hardcoded values" - Still in README

**Location**: `README.md` line 180

**Problem**: 
- Claims "zero hardcoded values"
- Reality: Fallback defaults exist (documented in CONFIG_AUDIT.md)

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "config-driven parameters"
- Removed absolute "zero" claim

### 5. ⚠️ "ensuring same config → same results" - Too Absolute

**Location**: `README.md` line 234

**Problem**: 
- "ensuring" implies guarantee
- Reality: Reproducibility depends on environment, library versions, etc.

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "for same config → same results"
- Removed absolute guarantee language

### 6. ⚠️ "Complete Single Source of Truth" in ROADMAP

**Location**: `ROADMAP.md` multiple places

**Problem**: 
- "Complete" implies 100% coverage
- Reality: Some fallback defaults exist

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "Single Source of Truth" (removed "Complete")
- Consistent with README fixes

### 7. ⚠️ "Complete Documentation" - Overselling

**Location**: `ROADMAP.md` line 40

**Problem**: 
- "Complete" is subjective and unverifiable
- "enterprise legal package" → should be "commercial"

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "Documentation & Legal — 4-tier docs hierarchy + commercial legal package"
- Removed "Complete" and "enterprise" marketing terms

### 8. ⚠️ "Fully operational" vs "End-to-end testing underway"

**Location**: `ROADMAP.md` line 50

**Problem**: 
- Says "Fully operational" but also "End-to-end testing underway"
- Contradiction: Can't be fully operational if still testing

**Fix**: 
- Changed to "Operational" (removed "Fully")
- More honest about testing status

## Summary

**Total fixes**: 8 contradictions/overselling issues  
**Files updated**: README.md, ROADMAP.md  
**Principles applied**:
1. Remove absolute language ("fully", "zero", "ensuring", "complete")
2. Resolve contradictions between files
3. Qualify claims with actual status ("under testing", "when available")
4. Remove marketing qualifiers ("enterprise" → "commercial")

## Remaining Honest Statements

All claims now:
- ✅ Match actual implementation status
- ✅ Are consistent across files
- ✅ Use qualified language instead of absolutes
- ✅ Acknowledge limitations and testing status
