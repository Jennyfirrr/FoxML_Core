# Marketing Language Removal Summary

## Changes Made to Remove Marketing/Over-selling

### README.md Changes

1. **"leakage-safe" → "ML infrastructure"**
   - Removed marketing qualifier, kept factual description

2. **"reference architecture for high-throughput" → "config-driven ML pipeline architecture"**
   - Removed "reference" (vague) and "high-throughput" (unverified)

3. **"high-performance" → removed**
   - Removed unverified performance claim

4. **"reference-grade architecture" → "modular architecture"**
   - Replaced vague marketing term with factual description

5. **"performance-optimized" → "performance-focused"**
   - Softened claim from "optimized" (implies proof) to "focused" (describes intent)

6. **"demonstrates" → "provides"**
   - Changed from marketing language to factual statement

7. **"simple usage" → "usage"**
   - Removed subjective "simple" qualifier

8. **"Scalable ML workflow" → "ML workflow"**
   - Removed "Scalable" (vague marketing term without evidence)

   - Removed "optimized" claim (no benchmarks to prove optimization)

10. **"Simplified" → removed**

13. **"enterprise-focused terms" → "commercial license terms"**
    - More accurate, less marketing-focused

14. **"enterprise licensing" → "commercial licensing"**
    - More accurate terminology

    - Removed vague "specialized" qualifier

### DOCS/00_executive/DETERMINISTIC_TRAINING.md

1. **"Enterprise-Grade ML Infrastructure" → "ML Infrastructure"**
   - Removed marketing qualifier

## Principles Applied

1. **Remove vague marketing terms**: "reference-grade", "high-performance", "scalable", "enterprise-grade"
2. **Remove unverified claims**: "optimized", "high-throughput" (without benchmarks)
3. **Remove subjective language**: "simple", "easy", "straightforward"
4. **Remove absolute claims**: "safe", "ensures", "guaranteed" → factual descriptions
5. **Use factual language**: "provides" instead of "demonstrates", "for" instead of "optimized for"
6. **Be specific**: "commercial" instead of "enterprise" (more accurate)

## Result

Documentation now uses factual, technical language instead of marketing speak. Claims are verifiable or clearly qualified. This builds trust through honesty rather than hype.
