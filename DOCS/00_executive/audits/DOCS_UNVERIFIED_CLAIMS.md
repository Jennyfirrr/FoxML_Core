# Unverified Claims Analysis

## Claims Without Verified Test Coverage

### 1. ⚠️ "Leakage-safe research architecture" / "Leakage-safe validation"

**Location**: `README.md` lines 10, 36, 160

**Claim**: "Leakage-safe research architecture with pre-training leak detection and auto-fix"

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Code exists: `TRAINING/common/leakage_auto_fixer.py`
- ❌ **No test files found**: Only 3 test files in `TRAINING/tests/`:
  - `test_no_hardcoded_hparams.py` (SST compliance)
  - `test_sequential_mode.py` (training mode)
  - No leakage detection/auto-fix tests

**Recommendation**: 
- Add tests for leakage detection accuracy
- Add tests for auto-fix functionality
- Add integration tests for end-to-end leakage prevention
- Qualify claim: "Leakage detection and auto-fix system (under validation)"

### 2. ⚠️ "High-throughput data processing"

**Location**: `README.md` line 38

**Claim**: "High-throughput data processing with Polars-optimized pipelines"

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Code uses Polars
- ❌ **No benchmarks in README**: Performance metrics only in technical docs (`DOCS/03_technical/benchmarks/`)
- ❌ **No comparative benchmarks**: No "vs. Pandas" or "vs. baseline" comparisons
- ⚠️ **Vague claim**: "High-throughput" is relative - compared to what?

**Recommendation**:
- Add specific benchmarks to README (e.g., "Processes 1M rows in X seconds")
- Or qualify: "Data processing optimized with Polars"
- Remove "high-throughput" if benchmarks aren't available

### 3. ⚠️ "High-performance research and machine learning infrastructure"

**Location**: `README.md` line 14

**Claim**: "high-performance research and machine learning infrastructure stack"

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ GPU acceleration exists
- ❌ **No performance benchmarks in README**
- ❌ **No test coverage for performance claims**
- ⚠️ **Subjective term**: "High-performance" is relative

**Recommendation**:
- Add specific performance metrics (if available)
- Or qualify: "Performance-optimized infrastructure"
- Or remove "high-performance" qualifier

### 4. ⚠️ "Reference-grade architecture"

**Location**: `README.md` line 15

**Claim**: "reference-grade architecture for ML pipelines"

**Evidence Found**:
- ❌ **Vague, unverifiable claim**: What makes it "reference-grade"?
- ❌ **No definition**: No criteria or standards cited
- ❌ **Not testable**: This is a subjective marketing term

**Recommendation**:
- Remove "reference-grade" (too vague)
- Or replace with specific, verifiable claims: "Well-structured architecture" or "Modular architecture"
- Or define what "reference-grade" means with specific criteria

### 5. ⚠️ "Automated leakage detection with pre-training scans and auto-fix system"

**Location**: `README.md` line 158

**Claim**: "Automated leakage detection with pre-training scans and auto-fix system"

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Code exists and appears functional
- ❌ **No automated tests found**: No test suite verifying auto-fix works correctly
- ❌ **No validation tests**: No tests that verify leaks are actually caught
- ⚠️ **"Automated" claim**: Code exists but not verified through tests

**Recommendation**:
- Add test suite for leakage detection accuracy
- Add integration tests for auto-fix workflow
- Qualify: "Automated leakage detection system (under validation)" until tests exist

### 6. ⚠️ "Ensures consistent logging and correct purge/embargo calculation"

**Location**: `README.md` line 34

**Claim**: "Centralized configuration resolution ensures consistent logging and correct purge/embargo calculation"

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Code exists: `TRAINING/utils/resolved_config.py`
- ❌ **"Ensures" is too strong**: No tests verifying correctness
- ❌ **"Correct" is unverifiable**: What is "correct"? No validation tests

**Recommendation**:
- Qualify: "Centralized configuration resolution for consistent logging and purge/embargo calculation"
- Remove "ensures" and "correct" (too absolute)
- Add validation tests if claiming correctness

### 7. ⚠️ "Production-grade ML infrastructure" (ROADMAP vs README contradiction)

**Location**: `ROADMAP.md` line 42 vs `README.md` line 4

**Contradiction**:
- `ROADMAP.md`: "This is production-grade ML infrastructure, not a prototype."
- `README.md`: "⚠️ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT — EXPECT BREAKING CHANGES... Use at your own risk in production environments."

**Recommendation**:
- Remove "production-grade" from ROADMAP (contradicts README warnings)
- Or update README to match ROADMAP (if it's actually production-ready)
- Be consistent across all docs

### 8. ⚠️ "Performance-optimized engineering"

**Location**: `README.md` line 15

**Claim**: "performance-optimized engineering"

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ GPU acceleration exists
- ✅ Polars used for data processing
- ❌ **No benchmarks**: No proof of optimization effectiveness
- ❌ **No before/after comparisons**: Can't verify "optimized" claim

**Recommendation**:
- Add benchmarks showing optimization impact
- Or qualify: "Engineering with performance considerations"
- Or remove "optimized" if benchmarks aren't available

## Summary of Recommendations

### High Priority (Factual Accuracy)
1. **Remove or qualify "production-grade"** - Contradicts README warnings
2. **Add test coverage for leakage detection** - Core feature claim needs verification
3. **Remove vague terms** - "Reference-grade", "high-performance" without benchmarks

### Medium Priority (Clarity)
4. **Qualify "automated" claims** - Add "(under validation)" until tests exist
5. **Remove absolute language** - "Ensures", "correct" → "provides", "calculates"
6. **Add benchmarks or remove performance claims** - "High-throughput" needs data

### Low Priority (Style)
7. **Define subjective terms** - If keeping "reference-grade", define criteria
8. **Add test coverage documentation** - Show what's tested vs. what's not

## Test Coverage Gaps

**Current Test Files Found**: Only 3 files in `TRAINING/tests/`
- `test_no_hardcoded_hparams.py` - SST compliance ✅
- `test_sequential_mode.py` - Training mode ✅
- Missing: Leakage detection, auto-fix, performance, reproducibility validation

**Recommendation**: Add test suite or qualify all claims that depend on untested functionality.
