# Decision Policies Configuration
# Thresholds and heuristics for decision-making policies

# Feature instability policy
feature_instability:
  # Jaccard similarity thresholds
  jaccard_threshold: 0.5  # Trigger if jaccard_topK < 0.5
  jaccard_collapse_ratio: 0.8  # Trigger if jaccard drops by 20% (current < previous * 0.8)
  min_runs: 3  # Minimum runs needed to evaluate
  min_recent_runs: 2  # Minimum recent runs for comparison

# Route instability policy
route_instability:
  # Route entropy threshold
  entropy_threshold: 1.5  # Trigger if route_entropy > 1.5
  # Route change frequency
  change_threshold: 3  # Trigger if 3+ route changes in last N runs
  change_window: 5  # Number of recent runs to check for changes
  min_runs: 3  # Minimum runs needed to evaluate

# Feature explosion decline policy
feature_explosion_decline:
  # AUC decline threshold
  auc_decline_threshold: -0.01  # Trigger if AUC drops by > 0.01
  # Feature increase threshold
  feature_increase_threshold: 10  # Trigger if features increase by > 10
  min_runs: 3  # Minimum runs needed to evaluate

# Class balance drift policy
class_balance_drift:
  # Pos rate drift threshold
  drift_threshold: 0.1  # Trigger if pos_rate drifts by > 10%
  min_runs: 3  # Minimum runs needed to evaluate
  min_recent_runs: 2  # Minimum recent runs for comparison
