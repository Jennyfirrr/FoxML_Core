# Stability Analysis Configuration
# Thresholds for feature importance stability analysis

importance_diff:
  # Absolute difference threshold
  diff_threshold: 0.1  # Minimum absolute difference to flag
  
  # Relative difference threshold
  relative_diff_threshold: 0.5  # Minimum relative difference (50%) to flag
  
  # Minimum importance threshold
  min_importance_full: 0.01  # Minimum importance in full set to consider
  
  # Top N features to analyze
  top_n: 10  # Number of top features to compare
