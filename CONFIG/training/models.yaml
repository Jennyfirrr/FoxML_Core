# Training Model Configuration
# Defines model families and hyperparameters for training (not feature selection/ranking)

# Note: Model-specific hyperparameters are in CONFIG/model_config/
# This file references those and adds training-specific settings

model_families:
  # Model families are loaded from CONFIG/model_config/ files
  # Training can have different hyperparameters than ranking/feature selection
  # (e.g., more iterations, different learning rates for final training)
  
  # Example structure (actual configs loaded from model_config/):
  # lightgbm:
  #   enabled: true
  #   config_path: model_config/lightgbm.yaml
  #   training_overrides:
  #     n_estimators: 500  # More for training than ranking
  #     learning_rate: 0.03
  
  # For now, we'll use the same multi_model config structure
  # but training can override specific hyperparameters

# Training-specific settings
training:
  folds: 5
  validation_split: 0.2
  early_stopping: true
  # seed: auto-injected from defaults.randomness.seed (or pipeline.determinism.base_seed)

# Cross-validation settings
cross_validation:
  folds: 5
  shuffle: false  # Time series CV should NOT shuffle (preserves temporal order)
  # seed: auto-injected from defaults.randomness.seed (or pipeline.determinism.base_seed)
