# Comprehensive Feature Ranking Configuration
# Combines target-dependent (predictive) and target-independent (quality) metrics

# Target-dependent (predictive edge) weights
predictive_weights:
  model_importance: 0.50  # Weight for model-based importance
  consensus: 0.30  # Weight for cross-model agreement
  consistency: 0.20  # Weight for consistency across symbols

# Target-independent (data quality edge) weights
quality_weights:
  completeness: 0.40  # Weight for low missing rate
  variance: 0.35  # Weight for high variance (more informative)
  distribution: 0.25  # Weight for distribution quality (skewness, kurtosis)

# Redundancy penalty
redundancy:
  max_correlation_penalty: 0.20  # Penalty for high correlation with other features
  high_corr_threshold: 0.90  # Correlation threshold for "high correlation"
  n_high_corr_penalty: 0.10  # Additional penalty per highly correlated feature

# Composite edge score weights
composite_weights:
  predictive: 0.50  # Weight for predictive edge
  quality: 0.30  # Weight for data quality edge
  redundancy: -0.20  # Penalty for redundancy (negative = penalty)

# Model families for predictive metrics
model_families:
  - lightgbm
  - random_forest
  - neural_network

# Sampling
sampling:
  max_samples_per_symbol: 50000
  # seed: auto-injected from defaults.randomness.seed (or pipeline.determinism.base_seed)

# Output configuration
output:
  save_csv: true
  save_json: true
  save_report: true
  top_n_display: 50  # Number of top features to display in report

# Feature filtering
filtering:
  min_variance: 1e-6  # Minimum variance threshold
  max_missing_rate: 0.95  # Maximum missing rate (95% = exclude)
  exclude_constant: true  # Exclude features with zero variance
