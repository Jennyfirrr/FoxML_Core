# Run Identity Configuration
# Controls how strictly run identity is enforced for reproducibility tracking

# =============================================================================
# IDENTITY ENFORCEMENT
# =============================================================================
identity:
  # Mode for identity enforcement at snapshot save time
  # - strict: Fail if any required signature is missing (PRODUCTION DEFAULT)
  # - relaxed: Log error but continue with degraded identity
  # - legacy: Allow snapshots without identity (backward compat only)
  #
  # SST: If reproducibility.yaml mode=strict, identity mode is ALWAYS strict
  # regardless of this setting. This config only applies when reproducibility
  # mode is best_effort. See get_identity_mode() in fingerprinting.py.
  mode: strict  # Default strict (only used when reproducibility.mode != strict)

# =============================================================================
# STABILITY ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================
stability:
  # Mode for stability analysis grouping/validation
  # - strict: All signatures must match, including train_seed
  # - replicate: All signatures must match, exclude train_seed (cross-seed stability)
  # - legacy: Best-effort grouping by universe_sig only
  filter_mode: replicate
  
  # Whether to include legacy snapshots (without identity) in analysis
  # Set to true only during migration from old snapshots
  allow_legacy_snapshots: false
  
  # Minimum snapshots required for stability metrics
  min_snapshots: 2

# =============================================================================
# FEATURE IDENTITY
# =============================================================================
feature_identity:
  # How to compute feature_signature
  # - registry_resolved: Use registry metadata per-feature (recommended)
  # - names_only: Just feature names (deprecated)
  mode: registry_resolved
