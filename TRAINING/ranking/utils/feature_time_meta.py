Feature Time Semantics Metadata

Defines per-feature time semantics for multi-interval + embargo-aware feature pipeline.
This enables features with different native intervals (5m, 15m, 1d) to be safely combined
without lookahead bias.

Key concept: Features are aligned by "availability timestamp" (feature_ts + embargo),
not by feature timestamp. This prevents leakage when mixing intervals.
